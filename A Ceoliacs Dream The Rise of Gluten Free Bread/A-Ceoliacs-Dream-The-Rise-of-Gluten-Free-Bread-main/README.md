# A Ceoliacs Dream the Rise of Gluten-Free Bread

The PDF attached is a report written for a mandatory University of Edinburgh course named "Group Project". Our group designed a gluten-free bread by looking for proteins that replicate best the ones found in gluten. This was a purely theoretical project, as much as we did want to test our recipe in the lab we did not have the time.

Thank you to our supervisor who helped guide us through this project: Jean-Christophe Denis

## Abstract:
This report provides evidence to suggest that people with coeliac disease and gluten intolerance are generally dissatisfied with the texture of current gluten free bread alternatives. It proceeds to lay out the groundwork for designing a gluten free flour that resembles the effects of wheat flour on dough and bread rheology by considering the thermodynamics of concentrated polymer doughs. We found that a polymer‚Äôs microscopic morphology plays a key role in dough rheology, which can be reduced to the ratio $\sqrt{N\nu / l^3}$ (the key ratio $\kappa$), where N is the number of monomers in a polymer, œÖ is the monomer volume and ùëô is the length of the monomer. The report continues to design a chemical recipe for a gluten free flour resembling strong wheat flour using proteins available in common grains. Finally, the economic, environmental, and nutritional suitability of the flour recipe is examined; with particular emphasis placed on the industrial challenges related to extracting these compounds from grains.
